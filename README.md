## ðŸš€ About

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a groundbreaking class of machine learning models. A GAN consists of two networks:

- **Generator**: Creates synthetic data that mimics real data.
- **Discriminator**: Differentiates between real and generated data.

These two networks are trained in a zero-sum game, pushing the Generator to produce increasingly realistic outputs. GANs have applications in:

- **Image Synthesis**: Generating high-quality, photorealistic images.
- **Image-to-Image Translation**: Transforming images from one domain to another.
- **Unpaired Domain Adaptation**: Learning mappings between datasets without direct pairings.
- **Progressive Learning**: Generating high-resolution images via stepwise training.
